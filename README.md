This application is designed to help you to open maven and npm projects very quickly. The application is activated via a specified hotkey, and will allow you to search over indexed projects and open them using an IDE of your choosing. 

Although any executable can be specified and used to launch the pom.xml or package.json file, Intellij, Webstorm, and Visual Studio Code are supported out of the box.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

The page will reload if you make edits. Edits to any electron parts require the app to be restarted<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run dist`

Packages the application and builds an executable file that can be installed on other Windows machines.
